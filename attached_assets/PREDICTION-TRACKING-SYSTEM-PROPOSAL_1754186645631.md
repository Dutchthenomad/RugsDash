# 40-TICK PREDICTION TRACKING SYSTEM PROPOSAL

## Overview
A focused tracking system to log when the system predicts a game will end within 40 ticks and compare against actual game endings. This data will form the baseline for future calibration.

## Core Objectives
1. **Track every 40-tick prediction** with precise timing
2. **Record actual game endings** to measure accuracy
3. **Store data for analysis** and future calibration
4. **No guessing or assumptions** - only track what actually happens

## Data Schema

### Prediction Record
```javascript
{
  predictionId: "game_123_tick_456",
  gameId: "game_123",
  predictionTick: 456,
  predictedEndWindow: {
    start: 456,
    end: 496  // 40 ticks later
  },
  gameState: {
    currentMultiplier: 2.45,
    volatility: 0.025,
    ticksSinceStart: 456,
    timestamp: 1706371200000
  },
  confidence: 0.75,  // If available from existing system
  triggerReason: "volatility_spike" // What triggered the prediction
}
```

### Outcome Record
```javascript
{
  predictionId: "game_123_tick_456",
  gameId: "game_123",
  actualEndTick: 478,
  withinWindow: true,
  ticksEarly: 18,  // 496 - 478
  accuracy: "early_accurate",  // early_accurate, on_time, late_miss, false_positive
  timestamp: 1706371245000
}
```

## Tracking Categories

### 1. Timing Accuracy
- **Early Accurate**: Game ended within window (good for side bets)
- **On Time**: Game ended exactly at predicted time
- **Late Miss**: Game ended after 40-tick window
- **False Positive**: Game didn't end within reasonable time (e.g., 100+ ticks)

### 2. Window Performance
- **Within Window Rate**: % of predictions where game ended in 40-tick window
- **Average Timing**: Mean ticks early/late
- **Optimal Range**: % ending 10-30 ticks early (best for side bets)

## Implementation Components

### 1. Prediction Logger
```javascript
class PredictionTracker {
  async logPrediction(gameId, currentTick, gameState) {
    const prediction = {
      predictionId: `${gameId}_tick_${currentTick}`,
      gameId,
      predictionTick: currentTick,
      predictedEndWindow: {
        start: currentTick,
        end: currentTick + 40
      },
      gameState,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    };
    
    await this.storage.savePrediction(prediction);
    return prediction.predictionId;
  }
}
```

### 2. Outcome Matcher
```javascript
class OutcomeMatcher {
  async recordGameEnd(gameId, endTick) {
    // Find all active predictions for this game
    const activePredictions = await this.storage.getActivePredictions(gameId);
    
    for (const prediction of activePredictions) {
      const outcome = this.calculateOutcome(prediction, endTick);
      await this.storage.saveOutcome(outcome);
    }
  }
  
  calculateOutcome(prediction, actualEndTick) {
    const windowEnd = prediction.predictedEndWindow.end;
    const withinWindow = actualEndTick <= windowEnd;
    const ticksEarly = windowEnd - actualEndTick;
    
    return {
      predictionId: prediction.predictionId,
      gameId: prediction.gameId,
      actualEndTick,
      withinWindow,
      ticksEarly,
      accuracy: this.categorizeAccuracy(ticksEarly),
      timestamp: Date.now()
    };
  }
}
```

### 3. Storage System
```javascript
// File-based storage for persistence
const STORAGE_STRUCTURE = {
  predictions: {
    active: {},      // Currently tracking
    completed: []    // Matched with outcomes
  },
  outcomes: [],      // All outcome records
  metrics: {
    totalPredictions: 0,
    withinWindowCount: 0,
    averageTicksEarly: 0,
    lastUpdated: null
  }
};
```

## Metrics to Track

### Primary Metrics
1. **Within Window Rate**: Core accuracy metric
2. **Average Timing**: How early/late predictions are
3. **False Positive Rate**: Predictions where game continues 100+ ticks

### Secondary Metrics
1. **By Tick Range**: Accuracy at different game stages
2. **By Volatility**: Performance in different volatility conditions
3. **By Confidence**: If confidence scores are available

## Data Collection Process

### Phase 1: Pure Tracking (Week 1)
- Log all 40-tick predictions
- Record all game endings
- No adjustments or optimizations
- Build baseline dataset

### Phase 2: Analysis (Week 2)
- Calculate accuracy metrics
- Identify patterns in successful predictions
- Find optimal trigger conditions
- Document timing distributions

### Phase 3: Calibration Preparation
- Export cleaned dataset
- Identify calibration parameters
- Prepare for threshold adjustments
- Design learning algorithms

## No Speculation Policy

This system will:
- ✓ Track exactly what the current system predicts
- ✓ Record exactly when games end
- ✓ Calculate precise accuracy metrics
- ✓ Store raw data for analysis

This system will NOT:
- ✗ Guess at optimal thresholds
- ✗ Implement untested algorithms
- ✗ Make assumptions about patterns
- ✗ Auto-adjust without data

## Next Steps

1. **Implement basic tracking** in existing sidebet system
2. **Add prediction triggers** to current recommendation logic
3. **Create outcome matching** when games end
4. **Start collecting data** immediately
5. **Generate daily reports** for monitoring
6. **After 1 week**: Analyze data for calibration insights

## Expected Outcomes

After 1-2 weeks of tracking:
- 1000+ prediction/outcome pairs
- Clear accuracy baseline (e.g., "currently 67% within window")
- Timing distribution (e.g., "average 12 ticks early when correct")
- Identification of problem areas (e.g., "false positives mostly occur at tick 200-250")

This data becomes the foundation for the smart self-learning system, but we don't build that until we have real tracking data to work with.
